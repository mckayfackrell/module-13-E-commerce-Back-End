## Installation 
The user should clone the repository from GitHub. This application requires MySQL2 and Sequelize. 

Youâ€™ll need to use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create your database using MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

## Usage

The user will first run schema and seed commands to create a seeded database.

When the user invokes the application, the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MYSQL database.

The user can then open API Get routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags. 

The data will be displayed in a formatted JSON. 

The user can then use the corresponding API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core to create, update and delete data in the database.
